# Skeptic Response to Strategist -- Debate 2 (Threat-Model Skill Ceiling)

**Their position:** Sonnet 4.6 as default is correct; add a conditional upgrade trigger for complex multi-system threat models (3+ trust boundaries, supply chain vectors), keeping 85-90% of invocations at Sonnet while protecting the high-consequence 10-15% with Opus.

**My response:** Modify

**Reasoning:** The conditional upgrade trigger is a step in the right direction but does not resolve the core problem: who classifies whether a threat model "spans 3+ trust boundaries"? If the threat-model skill itself is running at Sonnet, Sonnet is the model deciding whether it needs Opus -- and Sonnet has a well-documented blind spot for precisely the multi-hop chains that make a model "complex." The Dunning-Kruger failure mode here is concrete: Sonnet will competently enumerate the obvious trust boundaries (client/server, server/database, internal/external) and conclude there are only 2, missing that the internal metadata service, the CI/CD pipeline, and the third-party OAuth provider each constitute additional trust boundaries. It counts 2 because it did not think adversarially enough to identify 5. The conditional trigger never fires, and we get a false-negative Sonnet-tier analysis with no escalation. Strategist's proposal works only if the classification step runs at a tier capable of adversarial enumeration -- which is the very capability we are trying to gate. This is why I proposed the Cascade pattern in Round 1: Sonnet does the initial STRIDE pass, then Opus reviews the output specifically for missed boundaries and chain gaps. The classification is not "does this need Opus?" but rather "Opus, did Sonnet miss anything?" -- a verification pattern that avoids the self-assessment problem entirely.

**On Architect's schema point:** Architect's observation that `preferred: sonnet` + `reasoning_demand: high` is an invalid state directly strengthens my position. The spec says `reasoning_demand: high` means "hold at opus in the yellow zone," but a sonnet-preferred skill never reaches opus through the degradation cascade -- the cascade only downgrades, it does not upgrade. So the current frontmatter is making a promise the routing system cannot keep. The skill's own metadata declares "I need high reasoning" while simultaneously capping itself at a tier the spec does not consider sufficient for high-reasoning tasks. This is not a cosmetic inconsistency -- it means the frontmatter validator should be rejecting this configuration, and the fact that it does not means we have a validation gap. Architect is right that this combination should be treated as an invalid state. The resolution is one of: (a) set `preferred: opus, minimum: sonnet` to match the `reasoning_demand: high` declaration, (b) set `reasoning_demand: medium` to match the `preferred: sonnet` declaration, or (c) introduce a new routing mechanism (like the Cascade pattern) that the schema can express. Option (b) is dishonest -- the task genuinely demands high reasoning. Option (a) is expensive but correct. Option (c) is the best compromise but requires schema work.

**Revised severity:** High -- unchanged. The Architect's schema analysis adds a structural argument to what was already a safety argument. We now have both a "this is unsafe" and a "the data model cannot represent the intended behavior" case for changing the status quo.
