# Architect Position -- Model Routing Decisions

## Debate 1: SOC Coordinator Tier

The spec is unambiguous on this point: "Coordinators route, they don't reason" (spec line 103, config line 8-10). A coordinator's job is pattern matching an inbound request against a routing table and dispatching to the correct specialist -- this is structurally identical regardless of whether the domain is frontend, DevOps, or security. The classification logic is the same shape: read the request, match keywords and intent signals, select a specialist, hand off. Setting the SOC coordinator to `preferred: sonnet` introduces an inconsistency that undermines the entire tier model. If we grant security coordinators a higher tier because the *domain* feels more serious, every domain owner will argue their coordinator is special too. The architectural principle should be: **classification complexity is a function of the routing table's branching factor, not the domain's risk profile.** If the SOC coordinator's routing table has more specialists or more ambiguous boundaries than other coordinators, the correct fix is to sharpen the routing table, not to throw a more expensive model at a fuzzy classification problem. Keep all coordinators at haiku.

## Debate 2: Threat-Model Skill Ceiling

The combination `preferred: sonnet, reasoning_demand: high` is architecturally coherent but semantically overloaded. Looking at the spec's degradation cascade (lines 147-158), `reasoning_demand: high` has exactly one function: it tells the budget system "hold at opus in the yellow zone." But if the skill's `preferred` is sonnet, it never reaches opus in the first place -- the budget system only *downgrades* from preferred, it does not *upgrade*. So `reasoning_demand: high` on a sonnet-preferred skill means: "in the yellow zone, do not downgrade me below sonnet." That is functionally identical to setting `minimum: sonnet` with `reasoning_demand: medium`. The `high` designation is dead code in this configuration. The data model creates a false signal: someone reading the frontmatter sees `reasoning_demand: high` and infers this skill needs opus-class reasoning, but the `preferred: sonnet` contradicts that inference. Either the skill genuinely needs opus reasoning (set `preferred: opus, minimum: sonnet`) or it doesn't (set `reasoning_demand: medium`). The current combination is an invalid state that the frontmatter validator should reject.

## Debate 3: Opus Scope Boundary

The `reasoning` task type description ("Adversarial security analysis, formal verification, vulnerability chain synthesis") is too narrow and too domain-specific. It reads as a description of what the current security skills need, not as a general boundary definition for when opus-tier reasoning is warranted. The task_types table is the routing architecture's backbone -- it must generalize across all skill domains. Missing from the boundary definition: (1) multi-step causal reasoning across system boundaries (e.g., tracing a bug through three services), (2) adversarial reasoning in non-security contexts (e.g., identifying race conditions, reasoning about concurrent state), (3) novel problem solving where the solution is not a known pattern. The architectural principle should be: **opus is for tasks where the reasoning chain has high branching factor and the cost of a wrong intermediate step is high.** The description should be reformulated around cognitive properties (chain depth, branching factor, consequence of error) rather than domain-specific examples. Domain examples belong in per-skill `conditions` blocks, not in the global task_types table.
